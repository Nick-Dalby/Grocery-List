# Grocery-List ðŸ›’

Grocery list is a simple list taking app written in React and built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

- add, remove or edit list items
- list items are saved in local storage

The app is a demo of react hooks 'useState' and 'useEffect', passing and destructuring props with some conditionals thrown in for good measure.
